Clarification: Git vs Github
========================================================

![alt text](git_logo.png)

Git
- Version control system
- Projects and changes to them are stored in a repository (repo)
- Command line tool
- Repos are stored locally

Github
- Hosting service for Git repos
- Used to share repos and collaborate or get feedback
- Can use either command line or a GUI
- Repos can be public or private


Why GitHub? 
========================================================

- Use it to share and download open source code
- Not just for sharing pure code - can share data analysis projects too!
- Great for a job app (if computational)
- Can get involved in open source projects
- Social aspect


Setting up a GitHub account 
========================================================

GitHub Free Account 
- Free to sign up
- Public repos only

Recommended: Github Developer Account (paid, for 1 person)
- Unlimited private repos
- Free for students through the Student Developer Pack:
https://education.github.com/pack


Basic Project Structure
========================================================

Think branches


Other important terminology
========================================================

- Fork: copy the project to your own GitHub account
- Pull Request: a request to pull a fork back into the Master branch
- Commit: A "revision" or "snapshot" of a project 


Time for a quick GitHub tour!

You can host a website on GitHub!
========================================================

Or turn an existing project into a website.

Pros:
- Don't have to think about hosting and everything that comes with it
- No ads for a free site
- Show off and share your code or analysis projects

Cons:
- One website per user (but unlimited project pages)
